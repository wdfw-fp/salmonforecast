Description: NewPackages is a comprehensive R package for time series analysis, forecasting, and regression modeling. It includes a wide range of functionalities for working with time series data, performing regression analysis, and evaluating model performance. Key features include:
- One_step_ahead: Evaluate ARIMA model performance.
- Arima_forecast: Perform time series forecasting with or without exogenous variables using ARIMA models. It provides point forecasts, prediction intervals, and model information.
- All_subsets: Offers a robust set of functions for all subsets regression and time series forecasting on datasets with annual values of response and predictor covariates. This package equips data scientists and analysts with tools for model selection, statistical techniques, and powerful visualization capabilities.
- Find_stack_weights: Optimization algorithm to find best stacking weights
- Inseason_forecast_v2: Evaluate SARIMA model performance.
- Ensemble:It takes forecasts, series, TY_ensemble, k, and slide as inputs and performs ensemble analysis.
